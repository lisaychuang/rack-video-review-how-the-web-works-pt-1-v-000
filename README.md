## How the Web Works, Part 1- Overview

This video review lesson covers many of the concepts that you've learned about in this topic so far. To get the most out of these videos we recommend that you complete the Readings and Labs that come before it.

### Video summary

In this video, Avi will give us a brief overview of:
* History of Internet 
* How the Web Works

In 1901, Tesla predicted a future where data can be transmitted worldwide using soundwave, or [wireless telegraphy.]http://www.teslasociety.com/portugal.htm).  

In 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist invented the [World Wide Web.](http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/) - laying out his vision for what would become the web in a document called [“Information Management: A Proposal”.](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html)

By 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web 

1. HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.
2. URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.

Three parts of URI: 
* Protocol (http)
* Domain (github.com)
* Resource (/johnbritton)

3. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.

[HTTP request types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
[HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

[TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) is the basic communication language or protocol of the Internet. It can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network (either an intranet or an extranet). 

Another network protocol is [Telnet (TErminal NETwork)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-telnet-2626026), a network protocol used to provide a command line interface for communicating with a device.

The world is connected via submarine communications cables, you can find the complete [Submarine Cable Map here.](http://www.submarinecablemap.com/)

You will also learn about the [OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model](https://www.lifewire.com/open-systems-interconnection-model-816290) that defines internetworking in terms of a vertical stack of seven layers. Upper layers of the OSI model represent software that implements network services like encryption and connection management. Lower layers of the OSI model implement more primitive, hardware-oriented functions like routing, addressing, and flow control. 

**We will mostly be working on the TOP layer of Application as full stack engineers**

There are [two types of web apps:](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/creative-professional/static-dynamic-websites-theres-difference)
1. Static
2. Dynamic

Lastly, you will learn about the [Client Service Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model), a concept which can be simplified to:

**A client (e.g. web browser) send a request to servers to GET data; a server sends a response back to the client, and the client then renders its received content on page**

A server response is composed of 3 parts:
1. Structure (HTML)
2. Style (CSS)
3. Behavior (Javascript)

## How You Can Help Us Make These Videos Better

### Suggest Learning Objectives That We Can Add

As you watch the video, think about what the student is able to do at the end of it. What are the different steps and processes they'll know? Help us out by including individual learning objectives. As a general rule, here's the format that we use to write objectives.

Action Verb + Task or Object + Specific Conditions or Criteria we use when performing that action

So for example. here's a good learning objective: 

- Use the `gets` method to capture, store, and operate on input

Our action verb in this case is "Use." The verb then acts on the `gets` method. But what specifically do we want students to use the `get` method for? That's where the specific condition of "to capture, store, and operate on input" comes in. 


### How to Add a Summary or Objectives

There are two ways that you can do this. First, you can simply raise an issue (find the flag icon at the top right side of your lesson page) in Learn and title it either "Suggested Summary" or "Suggested Objectives" or if you want to be amazing and do both, then title it "Suggested Summary and Objectives."  In the body of the issue, write your suggestions, submit it, and you're done!

You can also edit the lesson (find the paper and pen icon at the top right side of your lesson page) in Learn. And once you click that you'll be able to add and submit your edits!
